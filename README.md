## Citation Author(s): AINI Labs
## Abstract
The dataset is oriented on encrypted traffic classification problems. The dataset contains three classes of flows: E-commerce flows, Video on-demand flows, and Interative flows. The dataset is collected by using the Wireshark tool. The dataset is collected from 12 different applications. The dataset is collected in the university campus network. The dataset is collected in the month of March 2023. The dataset is collected for the purpose of encrypted traffic classification. To improve the diversity of the data, we collect them on a PC running Ubuntu 18.04, Windows 10, or Mac OS X with Chromium-browser, Google Chrome, or Safari, respectively. A single capture file contains a single web page/video download trace for a particular OS and browser.
