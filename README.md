## Citation Author(s): AINI Labs
## Abstract
The dataset is oriented on encrypted traffic classification problems. dataset compose Netflow-GQUIC and additional datasets. The former is captured during three weeks from March 2018, including Youtube, Google Hangout Chat and Google Hangout VoIP. The latter is captured recently from March to April 2023, including video streaming of Facebook (called Facebook) and commercial websites in Southeast Asia such as Shopee, Tiki, Thegiodidong, Ebay, Amazon and Alibaba. In this paper, we take into account various services containing Chat, VoIP, video streaming and commercial websites. The reason is that these services occupy over 80 percent of global IP traffic by 2022 [37]. The number of flows for each application is depicted in Tab. I. To improve the diversity of the data, we collect them on a PC running Ubuntu 18.04, Windows 10, or Mac OS X with Chromium-browser, Google Chrome, or Safari, respectively. A single capture file contains a single web page/video download trace for a particular OS and browser.
